# Medal_Prediction_Using_Linear_Regression

This project involves building a predictive machine learning model to estimate the number of medals a country will achieve in a sports event. The model is based on key features such as the number of athletes and other relevant data.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing:** Clean and preprocess datasets for accurate analysis.
- **Feature Engineering:** Analyze and select important features contributing to medal predictions.
- **Model Building:** Train and evaluate predictive models using machine learning algorithms.
